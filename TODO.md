# TODO

## Functionality

* use audio file as a `Source`
  * [DONE] load from .wav files
    * use interpolation for mismatching sample rates
* reference a `Source` by name
* add test code for `Sampler` mechanism
* remove `get_duration`?
* distortion/overdrive effect
* rework AdditiveSource
  * add scaling factor -> mixer / equalizer
  * factor out offset source
* truncated source
* windowed transforms

## Research
* Review (Discrete) Fourier Transform concepts
* Learn more about signal processing tools
  * Discrete Wavelet Transform
* Learn more about audio processing techniques
* other ways to parametrize FFT efficiently
